Overview
----
Platino.ruble is a Titanium Studio add-on (ruble) which creates a starting point for developing apps with Platino. Two project templates are added to Titanium/Appcelerator studio, one for Alloy and one for Titanium classic. Code 'snippets' are also added for quick code generation.


### Features

**Platino Project Template** Go to `File > New > Mobile Project` and there will be a new entry to both Alloy and Titanium Classic with the Platino logo. These will each generate a blank project and a simple starter scene to help you get up and running with a new Platino project quickly!

**Snippets** When editing a file, go to the `Command > Platino SDK` menu and you'll be presented with a few useful snippets. Currently, there are snippets for requiring the Platino and Box2D modules, as well as snippets for generating empty Scene and module Scaffolds.
